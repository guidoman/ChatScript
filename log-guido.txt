Did you run away from home when you were little?You should try it some time. Travel broadens the mind.You think I should know?I ran away once, but my parents found me and dragged me back.I don't know but there must be some logic there somewhere.What scared you as a kid?Did you use a nightlite?I was scared of machines. I had vivid dreams of the Terminator robots.Did you have a happy childhood?You agree with me?I don't know what to say.OK. We agree.I don't know what to say.Glad you came back.
